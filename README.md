# mjauto

To install, clone repo and run the following command inside the repo dir:

```
pip install -e .
```

Before doing that, you'll likely want to install it into a virtual environment
versus your main Python distro.

1. `pip install virtualenv`
2. `virtualenv -p /your/personal/path/to/python3.9 devenv`
3. `source devenv/bin/activate`
4. Finally, `pip install -e .`

Check out `mjauto --help`.
